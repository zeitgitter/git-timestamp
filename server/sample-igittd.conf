#   (i.e., who could issue fake timestamps).
# - IGITT_CONTACT should have some contact information.
# - IGITT_COUNTRY should name the jurisdiction.
# They are all required except IGITT_DOMAIN.

# Rotate/commit/publish interval and offset
# `commit-interval`: Duration of the interval.
# `commit-offset`: Time relative to the start of the interval.
#
# It is important that the activity times do not cluster up, so please use
# an offset which nobody else uses; and an offset of 0 is generally not
# advisable, as other systems will already have activity then.
#
# So chose an interval reflecting the frequency you want to commit and publish,
# and chose a seemingly random offset in that period. Try to avoid the full
# hours and/or minutes, whenever possible; i.e., specify non-zero
# minutes/seconds. See `.../doc/ServerList.md` for additional advice.
#
# The interval and offset are relative to UTC (actually, relative to the Epoch,
# i.e., 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)
#
# :warning: If you are using the PGP Timestamper as an upstream
# commitment, please make sure that this does not trigger more than once
# an hour. (The PGP Timestamper can delay the commit by 5 minutes and
# more and the IGITT will wait for an answer for up to 15 minutes
# before continuing, so anything more frequent than this will cause
# chaos in your repository.)
#
# When using the PGP Timestamper as an upstream commitmemnt, the 
# actual commit will be delayed by up to 15 minutes. The rotation/
# commit process starts at the time specified.
#
# Time format: (Fractional) days, hours, minutes, and seconds,
# optionally separated by spaces, e.g. "1.5d", "3h 7m 3.5s", "8h20m17s"
#
# Examples:
# - commit-interval=1d, commit-offset=7h37m16s
# - commit-interval=4h, commit-offset=1h18m44s
# - commit-interval=1h, commit-offset=23m17s
# Default: 4h

# Please note that GnuPG serializes all private key operations through

# Default: 2
; max-parallel-signatures = 2

# Number of separate gpg-agents to run
# This is a (ugly) hack to work around the limitation above by "convincing"
# GnuPG that it should run several `gpg-agent`s and use them in round-robin
# fashion. This allows increasing `max-parallel-signatures` above.
# To maximize the use of available processor cores, set this to slightly
# higher than the number of actual cores and set `max-parallel-signatures`
# slightly higher than this.
# Default: 1
; number-of-gpg-agents = 1

# Maximum waiting time for a signature operation slot
# When `max-parallel-signatures` signatures are already being signed,
# *additional* requests will wait up to `max-parallel-timeout` seconds
# for an available signature process before being rejected.
# Default: None (forever)
# Can be set to a floating-point value to define the number of seconds
